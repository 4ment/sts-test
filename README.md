Sequential Tree Sampler (STS)
=============================

## Dependencies

* [smctc][smctc] - included as git submodule (`git submodule update --init`)
* [lcfit][lcfit] - included as git submodule (`git submodule update --init`)
* [Bio++ version 2.2.0][bpp] `core`, `seq`, and `phyl` modules. Note that debian & ubuntu up to 16.04 include v2.1.0 which is too old. Bio++ should be installed from source using the `bpp-setup.sh` script on these systems.
* [cmake][cmake]
* [gsl version 1.16][gsl] Note that gsl v2 is not currently supported.
* [nlopt][nlopt]
* [beagle][beagle] version 2.1 (Optional)
* [google test][gtest] this is libgtest on debian/ubuntu (Optional)

## Compiling

1. Install dependencies
2. run `make`

Binaries will be build in `_build/release`

## Adding taxa to an existing posterior

The tool `sts-online` adds taxa to an existing posterior tree sample.
`sts-online` operates on a fasta file and tree file in nexus format.
The fasta file must contain an alignment with a superset of the taxa in the tree file.

Currently only the Jukes-Cantor model is supported.

### Example invocation

    sts-online -b 250 -p 2 -proposal-method lcfit 10taxon-01.fasta 10tax_trim_t1.t 10tax_trim_t1.sts.json

In this example, we use an alignment containing 10 sequences and a posterior sample of trees generated by MrBayes with an alignment that does not contain the sequence labeled `t1`.
`sts-online` ignores the first 250 trees from `50tax_trim.run1.t` and  uses a particle factor of 2. The `10tax_trim_t1.sts.json` file will contain the updated trees.
