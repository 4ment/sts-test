/// \brief Adds a taxon to a tree.
///
/// Adds a taxon, \f$s\f$ to a particle using a pplacer-style proposal density on edges:
///
/// - Two passes are made over the tree; likelihood vectors are cached for both sides of every edge
/// - We calculate the log-likelihood of attaching \f$s\f$ at the midpoint of every edge (linear in number of edges,
///   with cached vectors), for every branch length in #proposePendantBranchLengths.
/// - Mid-edge LnLs form proposal density on edges
/// - Some ML-optimization is performed for attachment location on edge, pendant branch lengths; a branch length is
///   proposed from a distribution around these lengths.
///
/// For each time in <c>[1,taxa_to_add.size()]</c>, adds <c>taxa_to_add[time-1]</c> to the tree.
///
/// **NOTE**: All of the sequences in taxa_to_add must have partials registered in calculator.
///
/// The particle weight is updated using:
/// \f[
/// w_{r,k} = \frac{\gamma*(s_{r,k})}{\gamma*(s_{r-1,k})q(s_{r-1,k}\rightarrow s_{r,k})}
/// \f]
/// Where \f$\gamma*\f$ is the log-likelihood of the tree with \f$n-1\f$ and \f$n\f$ taxa, and the proposal density
/// \f$q(s_{r-1,k}\rightarrow s_{r,k})\f$ uses the mid-edge log-likelihood
